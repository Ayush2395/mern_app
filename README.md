## Building a web app with MERN stack

01 - CRUD: performing CRUD operations from the frontend on a mongo database  
02 - Auth: adding user authentication, user authorization, protected routes (using JWT)  
03 - socket.io (coming soon)

### To run an app:
- download and open a folder
- install the dependencies:
> npm install && npm --prefix frontend install
- set the environment variables in the .env (Connection String, JWT Secret)
- start frontend and backend simultaneously:
> npm run dev
- if it doesnt start, try to delete the files from the /frontend folder, except for the react-scripts, the package.json and the package-lock.json
