## Building a web app with MERN stack

01 - CRUD: performing CRUD operations from the frontend on a mongo database  
02 - Auth: adding user authentication, user authorization, protected routes (using JWT)  
03 - Chat: implementing general chat, chat rooms and private chatting (with socket.io)

### To run an app:
- download and open a folder
- install the dependencies in the root folder and in the frontend folder:
> npm install 
> cd frontend
> npm install
> cd..
- set the environment variables in the .env (Connection String, JWT Secret)
- start frontend and backend simultaneously (from the root directory):
> npm run dev
- if it doesn't start, try to delete the files (not the folders) from the /frontend folder, except for: package.json, package-lock.json, react-scripts
